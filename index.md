Welcome, friends, sports-lovers, and fellow statisticians! This blog was created with the intent to document my journey into the fascinating world of sports analytics. My goal is to learn how to apply the statistical methods I am currently learning to sports and share any of my successes (as well as all of my failures) in this field. I hope to be able to shed some light on the stats/math behind some sports and share this knowledge with people on a similar path as me. 

If you are a beginner, I love you and I support you. I hope that looking at my trials and errors will encourage you to continue your journey into this field. Let's learn how to improve together!

If you are a pro or someone already well-versed in sports analytics, please love and support me. I am very much not sure of what I am doing and would absolutely love any suggestions, comments, and advice!

I hope that you all continue to join me on this venture!
